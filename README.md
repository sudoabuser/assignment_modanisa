# Goal of the assignment
This assignment aims to execute a series of six randomly made-up user stories.

# Technologies used
I've used Javascript language and Puppeteer to extract data from http://todomvc.com/examples/vue/
and Cucumber-js framework for creating such cases.

# Usage

for overall testing of the all cases:
```javascript 
npm test 
```

testing just the modified cases:
```javascript
npm demo
```
(don't forget to add @demo tags in front of the cases in feature file)

# Publish
